# Proto files
The below files represent the current version that a customer has to use for decoding messages from CCS.

Using separate subfolders we plan to support an archive of older version (for reference) as well as development releases for assisting customers with adopting new releases as early as possible.

## .proto
The .proto files can be used to generate language specific files.

### client.proto
Is the basis for the client messages. 

The _messages_ payload in **StreamMessage** is going to contain data in the format of the following files, depending on the user subscription

### md_cef.proto
Contains messages for CEF sources like Microproducts, Tradegate, Xetra ETF/ETP, etc.

### md_energy
Contains messages for Energy exchange.

### md_crypto.proto
Contains messages for crypto currency sources

## .pb2.py
The pb2.py files are generated by Deutche Boerse from .proto. This is done simply to facilitate the run of the client as described in the repo main readme
